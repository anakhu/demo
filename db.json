      "description": "Le Petit Guiraud is a modern, fresh Sauternes that emphasizes the tension between botrytis-tinged sweetness and clean Sauvignon Blanc. Early apricots, honeycomb, orange butter combine across an intricate palate woven with zippy minerality and lemon curd. Balanced and complex, this is an ideal everyday Sauternes, meant for light desserts and also quail, roasted poultry with figs. The Petit Guiraud is 35 % Sauvignon Blanc and 65% Sémillon. Fermented separately by parcel and matured in new barrel 12 months. Château Guiraud is located in Barsac, a commune of the Sauternes appellation. The area is situated at higher elevation than Sauternes, is noted for its accessible, non-cloying dessert wines.",
